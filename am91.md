# ECE445

### 02/01/2022 Project Approved
We got our idea approved


### 08/02/2022 First meeting with our TA
He gave us general information about the project such as the budget that we have, told us to do 
the proposal

### 02/09/2022 Finishing the proposal
We have finished the last parts of our proposal. I have redact the introduction, 3 level requierments,
some sybsytems requirements, tolerance analisys and some ethics points.

### 02/10/2022 First proposal uploaded
We uploaded our first version of our proposal


### 02/14/2022 Design Document Check Sign-up
We signed in for the design document check on next Tuesday (02/22/2022) at 10 a.m.


### 02/15/2022 Analysis of possible cost of out project
We realized that we are goint to exceed for sure the budget. We have 150$ of budget and our project
is going to cost approximately 350$. It ha sense because we need solar panel, large battery, precise 
sensors and uvlight. UVlight water purification systems are sold for 2000$. Our project is cheap 
compared to that.


### 02/16/2022 Second meeting wwith the TA
In this meeting he told us that:
- We only need 3 level requirements, and simplify them. Put more details in the subsytem requirements
part. Delete the last one because is the weakest
-Put othe calculations for the minimum water flow requirement in the tolerance analysis part. Write 
abut the decrease in the maximum water flow as a measure to indicate when to remplace the filter
- Put in the tolerance analysis when the manufacturer recommend changing each of the filters 
(2 and 12 months).
- Check if the battery can be charged and charge at the same time. If not, implement a switch  or some
other way to know when the user is going to use the product.
-To add components to kicad, try to add some libraries
- Do the PCB as soon as possible.


### 02/18/2022 Soldering assignment done
I spent Friday morning soldering the board and testing its operation by programming it.

Looking information to solve the problem of charging and discharging the battery at the same time.
I have found that using a blocking diode between the solar panel and the battery could solve the
problem. The problem is that our solar panel maintain the voltage constant so this solution doesnt work


### 02/19/2022 Work with Kicad
I tried to find the components that we need in kicad -> they are not included in the main library
I tried to find other libraries that contain or components -> Nothing
I tried to design the microcontrollerkit with Kicad.


### 02/20/2022
Use a solar charge controller to charge the battery and power the load at the same time. And at night
use the battery as a supply.

Check our 18/25 grade in the proposal to improve and get a better mark in the design document

Realized that we dont need to add all of our compenents to the PCB. We just need to add the
connectors.

Add voltage regulators 15.4 to 12V and 12V to 5V to the excell. Draw a draft of our new blocks diagram.
See connections of each component.

### 02/21/2022
Finish the first draf ofthe design document to have it ready for the design document check.
Cost analysis and schedule.

### 02/22/2022
We present briefly our design document to Arne Fliflet in the design document check.
He told us:
- to simplify our 3 level requirements statements
- Add a physical picture
- Add the schematics
- Add more details about the current in the RV tables.
- Implement a prefilter to prevent our 0.2microfilter to collapse
-
### 02/232022
I have created a CAD model of the physical design using Fusion 360. Improving my skills with this program that I used before in a mechanical class.

## 02/24/2022
I realized that some components in our circuits were not going to work because we didnt have enough power deliver by our solar panel so i decided to change it. Aditionally i try to find more specific components such as the model of voltage regulator that we are going to use.

We finisht redacting the design document to submit it at night

### 02/27/2022
I spended the whole day trying to find more information about the components that we already have.

### 02/28/2022
I drew a first draft of the schematics adding some capacitors, resistors and inductors that we havent got into account yet.
We distribute what we were going to present in the design document presentation and prepare my part

### 03/01/2022
We did the presentation to Arne Fliflet. The presentation was great. They (professor and TAs didnt ask us a lot of questions so i think that everything was clear)

We couldnt go to pcb review because we dont have the pcb layout done yet.

### 03/02/2022
I realized that we need to use a mosfet to power our UVlight because it needs 100mA and the microcontroller is not able to provide that current.

I did peer review going to the presentations of team 11. Was very interesting and useful to see how they are working and take some ideas for our project.

I started creating the schematic using kikad.
