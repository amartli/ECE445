# ECE445

### 02/01/2022 Project Approved
We got our idea approved


### 08/02/2022 First meeting with our TA
He gave us general information about the project such as the budget that we have, told us to do 
the proposal

### 02/09/2022 Finishing the proposal
We have finished the last parts of our proposal. I have redact the introduction, 3 level requierments,
some sybsytems requirements, tolerance analisys and some ethics points.

### 02/10/2022 First proposal uploaded
We uploaded our first version of our proposal


### 02/14/2022 Design Document Check Sign-up
We signed in for the design document check on next Tuesday (02/22/2022) at 10 a.m.


### 02/15/2022 Analysis of possible cost of out project
We realized that we are goint to exceed for sure the budget. We have 150$ of budget and our project
is going to cost approximately 350$. It ha sense because we need solar panel, large battery, precise 
sensors and uvlight. UVlight water purification systems are sold for 2000$. Our project is cheap 
compared to that.


### 02/16/2022 Second meeting wwith the TA
In this meeting he told us that:
- We only need 3 level requirements, and simplify them. Put more details in the subsytem requirements
part. Delete the last one because is the weakest
-Put othe calculations for the minimum water flow requirement in the tolerance analysis part. Write 
abut the decrease in the maximum water flow as a measure to indicate when to remplace the filter
- Put in the tolerance analysis when the manufacturer recommend changing each of the filters 
(2 and 12 months).
- Check if the battery can be charged and charge at the same time. If not, implement a switch  or some
other way to know when the user is going to use the product.
-To add components to kicad, try to add some libraries
- Do the PCB as soon as possible.


### 02/18/2022 Soldering assignment done
I spent Friday morning soldering the board and testing its operation by programming it.

Looking information to solve the problem of charging and discharging the battery at the same time.
I have found that using a blocking diode between the solar panel and the battery could solve the
problem. The problem is that our solar panel maintain the voltage constant so this solution doesnt work


### 02/19/2022 Work with Kicad
I tried to find the components that we need in kicad -> they are not included in the main library
I tried to find other libraries that contain or components -> Nothing
I tried to design the microcontrollerkit with Kicad.


### 02/20/2022
Use a solar charge controller to charge the battery and power the load at the same time. And at night
use the battery as a supply.

Check our 18/25 grade in the proposal to improve and get a better mark in the design document

Realized that we dont need to add all of our compenents to the PCB. We just need to add the
connectors.

Add voltage regulators 15.4 to 12V and 12V to 5V to the excell. Draw a draft of our new blocks diagram.
See connections of each component.

### 02/21/2022
Finish the first fradt of the design document to have it ready for the design document check.
Cost analysis and schedule.
